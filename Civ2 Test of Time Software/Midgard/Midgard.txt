^^THE EPIC OF MIDGARD 
^
^      Volsang was frozen solid in his fortress in the far south of Midgard. Everyone 
^knew that he had been like this for a very long time - inasmuch as his frightful 
^story had been told forever. They knew he had once been very much alive, very 
^terrifying, and at the point of enslaving the world to his will when the brave Dreya 
^fortuitously discovered the spell that imprisoned him forever. 
^      Over the centuries the terror had faded into complacency and now his name only 
^frightened children at bedtime. What no one realized was that their forefathers' 
^victory hadn't been quite as complete as they believed and that the terror was about 
to return.
^
^Your goal is to destroy the re-awakening, evil wizard Volsang before he can escape
^the spell. You can succeed by either
^1. Conquering the world and, thereby, uniting the power of the races to successfully 
^overcome Volsang; or
^2. Building the ultimate weapon, the Great Siege Engine, that can expel Volsang from all 
^planes of existence; or 
^3. Locating Bifrost, the rainbow bridge that connects Midgard with Asgard, the home of 
^the gods. They will then help you defeat Volsang.
^It is common belief that you can only find Bifrost by intense research into the magic arts
^or by completion of several tasks set before you by the gods as a test of your 
^worthiness.
^NOTE: Don't rename your capital city if you care about these events working properly.
