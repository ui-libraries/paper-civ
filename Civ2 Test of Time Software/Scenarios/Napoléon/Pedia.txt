@title=Civilization: Governments
The form of government you choose for your civilization will
affect the way resources are distributed in your cities, the
rate at which your citizens can produce and sustain new units
and city improvements, and the extent to which your citizens
have a say in the way you govern them.
^
Some forms of government, such as Despotism, Monarchy, and
later Communism and Fundamentalism, allow you to expand
rapidly, to produce and sustain large numbers of military
units, and to control your affairs completely.
^
Democracy and the Republic, on the other hand, give your
citizens the freedom to produce vast amounts of trade, which
increases your wealth and knowledge rapidly. On the other
hand, your citizens may grow unhappy when you send military
units out of your cities; also, your Senate may try to
interfere in your conduct of foreign affairs.
^
To change your civilization's government, you must have a
Revolution--select "Revolution" from the Kingdom Menu.  This
will entail a brief period of Anarchy.

@PEDIAGOVT0
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Anarchy
Anarchy represents not so much a government type as the
lack of any stable government. Anarchy occurs when your
civilization's government falls, or when you decide to
have a Revolution. After a few turns of Anarchy, you will
be able to reconstitute your government.
^
Anarchy is similar to Despotism, except that the corruption
rate is VERY HIGH (see entry for Despotism).  However, no
taxes are collected during a period of Anarchy, and no
scientific research is conducted.

@title=Civilization Government: Not Used
Most of the governments have been disabled in Germanicus on 
the Rhine.  This is done because the Rhine Legions receive all 
the “happy” improvements and wonders.  If the German tribes 
and Imperial Romans were not given the fundamentalism government, 
they would constantly face unrest.
^
Owing to the diverse nature of the German tribes and Imperial 
Rome, I feel “autocracy” is the most mutually-pleasing name.

@title=Civilization Government: Army
In this scenario, you will rule as an Army(renamed from "Republic”).  
This reflects the difficulty of keeping the local population secure 
(happy) while maneuvering deep within Germania.  When your people 
grow too panicked, they will revolt and refuse to work.  If you do 
not address this quickly, you run the risk of triggering a large 
revolt, depending on your domestic policies.
