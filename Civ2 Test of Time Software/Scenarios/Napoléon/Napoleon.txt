^
"On December 2nd, 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte coronated himself as Emperor of France. By placing the crown upon his head with his own hands, Bonaparte brought Europe to the brink of war. For by its very nature, the act of self-coronation threatened the rule and challenged the legitimacy of every government then in existence.
^
To safeguard the sanctity of divine right and position based on noble birth, the European monarchies branded Bonaparte an international outlaw and pledged to remain at war with France until the Corsican usurper was overthrown and the Bourbon rule restored.
^
For the next ten years, the fate of the French Empire rested on the abilities of one man; as a warrior, and as a peacemaker."
^ 
Can you as the Emperor of France do better than your historical counterpart and become the absolute ruler of Europe or will you meet the same fate and find yourself exiled on a remote and desolate island to live out your remaining days?

House Rules
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
There are eight house rules in this scenario that I strongly recommend human 
players adhere to, which are:
%
• Firstly, changing city names is not permissible. A number of events apply to 
specific cities and altering names will render them inactive. 
%
• Secondly, it is forbidden to build new roads or upgrade to cobbled roads 
on the ‘European’ map.
%
• Thirdly, the building of new cities is prohibited.
%
• Fourthly, French "Sapeurs" may only build Siege Works tile improvements.

• Seventhly, the ONLY production that is EVER allowed for the cities on the 
‘European Powers’ map is the ‘(Money Market)’ improvement.

the ‘European Powers’ map to other tiles.
