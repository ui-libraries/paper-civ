Graphics Modpack for ToT's Original Game
========================================

This mod requires at least version 0.9 of TheNamelessOne's Test of Time Patch Project (ToTPP) to play. Download it here:

That, in turn, requires the official Test of Time version 1.1 patch. For installation details, see here:

Be aware that this mod will overwrite (and backup) your existing rules.txt file.

Installation
============

1. Extract the archive into your main Test of Time directory. This will create a new folder called Original_Graphics.
2. Open this folder, right-click the file Install.bat and select Run as administrator. For Windows Vista and later, you may need to disable User Account Control to allow the batch file to complete the installation successfully.
3. To install the mod, type 1. The batch file will automatically backup your original files. To uninstall the mod and restore your original files, type 2. To cancel, type 3.
4. You *must* have the 'Terrain overlays' option enabled in the ToTPP launcher.
5. The ToTPP's 'No stack kills' option and 'Incremental rush buying' exploit fix are enabled in the game's rules file. If you wish to play using these options, tick the corresponding boxes in the ToTPP launcher.
6. The units in this mod are not animated, so uncheck the Animated Units box under Graphic Options (Ctrl+P) in the Game menu. Terrain resources are animated so leave the Animated Terrain box checked.

Cities, Terrain and Units Art
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I've tried to be pretty thorough in providing the correct sources for all of the graphics. Where known, signatures are provided in the graphics files:

GB = Gareth "Fairline" Birch
CS = Curt Sibling
The catfish symbol = I wonder?
FavFly = Favoured Flight
Tec = Techumseh
Erwan = Erwan Catesson
TY = Typhoon

MP = MicroProse
AoK = Age of Kings (Ensemble Studios)
CTP = Call To Power (Activision)
Civ3 = Civilization 3 (Firaxis)
K2 = Kohan 2 (TimeGate Studios)
Legion = Legion (Slitherine Software)
AoM = Age of Mythology (Ensemble Studios)

People
¯¯¯¯¯¯
Most of these icons were created by me from photographs. Some are derived from the game, Dark Omen by Electronic Arts. Curt Sibling has made a number of excellent modifications to this set of icons - and I've further modified some of his work. One is from Bioware's Baldur's Gate 2 (Anyone recognise Mazzy?). 

Icons and Improvements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The main changes to these files include icons from Bernd "BeBro" Brosing and Big Huge Games' Rise of Nations, and Mercator's smooth tile grids.

Utilities
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
CivSprite by Jorrit "Mercator" Vermeiren - the sprites and team colour masks (which took me bloody ages, by the way) were generated using this program.

Updates
