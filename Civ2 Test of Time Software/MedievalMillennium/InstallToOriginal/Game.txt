@NOTONMAP
@title=Illegal Move
Units cannot move off the
edge of the map.

@ZOC
@width=440
@title=Game Concept: Zones of Control
In general, a unit may not move from one land tile
adjacent to an opponent's unit, into another land tile
which is also adjacent to an opponent's unit. There are
three exceptions to this rule:
^
First, a unit is always free to enter or exit a city
belonging to its own nation.
Second, a unit is always permitted to enter a tile which is
already occupied by a unit belonging to its own nation.
Third, some specific unit types are exempt from this rule
entirely: Envoys, Merchants, ships, and projectile units.

@FEATURE
@title=Gotta Say Unh.
Feature not yet implemented.

@AMPHIB
@title=Game Concept: Naval Assaults
Mounted and artillery units must be put ashore
before they can engage in combat.

@NONCOMBAT
@title=Game Concept: Combat Units
Units such as Peasants, Scouts, Merchants,
and Envoys, which have an Attack strength
of 0, are considered non-combat units. They
may not initiate combat with enemy units.

@FIGHTER
@title=Game Concept: Plague
Military units have no hope of weakening or eliminating
the plague by attacking it. This foolish course of action
is not permitted.

@FUEL
@title=Game Concept: Ranged Units
Projectiles fired by ranged units must
strike a target within that turn, or they
fall harmlessly to earth.

@FATIGUE
@title=Fatigue
These men are tired, Sire. If we force
them to attack this turn, they will fight at

and leave the ships behind?

Stay With Ships

@NOLANDFALL
