; TOTPP
; This is a collection of keys followed by a number of values,
;    terminated by a blank line.
; For ImpassableAir, when set to 1, air units respect impassable terrain. This can
;    still be overridden in @UNITS_ADVANCED on a per unit basis.
; For FortifyDefense/FortressDefense/CityWallsDefense, multiply by 50%
;    to get the percentage of the normal defense value a unit defends with.
;    E.g. 3 * 50% = 150% of normal defense
; Also, these bonuses don't stack, except as noted in the individual comments.
;    A fortified unit in a city with walls will only use the CityWallsDefense
;    value (like in the unmodified game).
; For CityPopulationLossAttack/CityPopulationLossCapture,
;    0=will lose population, 1=will not lose population,
;    2=will lose population except when size=1 and the loss would destroy the city
; For UnitShieldColor, values determine the color of a unit's shield.
;    It takes up to 2 values, for the primary and the secondary (used for
;    unit stacks) shield. Values are between 0 and 31, with 0 - black,
;    31 - tribe color. The values in between are darker (lower values)/lighter
;    (higher values) hues of the tribe's color. Default shield colors can be
;    configured through the "TOTPP Configuration" menu.
; For NoStackKills, the particular mechanics depend on the domain:
; - For land stacks, only the defender is killed;
; - For ship stacks carrying land units the defender is sunk together with its cargo;
; - For ships carrying air units (i.e. carriers or submarines) the defender is sunk
;   and the air units remain.
; For EventHeapSize, takes up to 2 values, the first is the (initial) heap size
;    to be used for events in bytes. The second value flags static/dynamic memory
;    allocation. When set to 1, it allows the event heap to dynamically allocate
;    more memory when needed. Dynamic mode is especially recommended when
;    making use of delayed events, in which case a particularly expensive
;    "defragmentation" operation to reclaim space is skipped.
; For NavigableRiversIntercardinal, 1 means only NE/SE/SW/NW movement on rivers,
;    0 would allow diagonal movement
; 'RailroadMultiplier', 'RoadMultiplier', 'RiverMultiplier', and 'AlpineMultiplier'
;    can be enabled individually. They take 2 values, the first needs to be set
;    to 1 to enable the multiplier, while the second value determines the movement
;    cost. E.g. setting 'RailroadMultiplier' to 1, 6 means a unit can move 6 tiles
;    along a railroad for 1 movement point. Setting the movement value to 0 means
;    the movement cost of the underlying terrain is used, setting it to -1 means
;    movement is unlimited. In game, all enabled movement multipliers are combined
;    into an aggregate movement multiplier (exactly their least common multiple).
;    This number multiplied by the movement rate from @UNITS must be less than 256
;    for each unit. You'll get a friendly warning when this limit is exceeded.
;    Note: the key 'MovementMultipliers' used in previous versions is now deprecated,
;    but the patch still respects it, so scenarios with the old configuration will
;    still work.
; For ProductionCarryOver, when enabled with value 1, excess shields carry over
;    to the next item after city production is completed. When specifying
;    three values instead of one, this behaviour can be configured per
;    production type (Units, Improvements & Wonders respectively).
; For LWPreserveVeterancy, when enabled, veterancy of units is preserved
;    when units are upgraded by the workshop.
; For  NumberOfAnimatedUnitSprites, if greater than 80, the train animation from
;    "unit99.spr" is read from "unit999.spr" (note the extra '9') to avoid conflicts
;    with the animation for unit 99.

; Adds a check to the transform order to see if the tribe has the technology
; required to transform that particular terrain type. This allows the designer
; to make transformations of "easy" terrain types available earlier in the tech-tree.
; Consists of one line per terrain type, containing a tech abbreviation and a comma.
; The order of terrain types is the same as in the @TERRAIN section.
; "nil" means no tech requirement, though you will still need a unit with engineering capabilities.
; @TRANSFORM1 .. @TRANSFORM3 can be used for secondary maps, similarly to @TERRAIN1-3.

; The @FERTILITY section consists of a list of terrain types, optionally accompanied
;    by 3 "fertility coefficients" 
; Adding a terrain type to this section allows it to be settled by the AI.
; Conversely, terrain types not in this section will never be settled by the AI.
; The "fertility coefficients" can be used to make a terrain type more or less desirable.
;    These 3 values are multiplied by the food, shields and trade values of the terrain type,
;    respectively. The sum of these multiplications determines the fertility value. In the above
;    example, a grassland tile will get a fertility value of 0, since all its coefficients are 0.
;    Tundra on the other hand, will get a fertility value of 6, given its default tile production
;    of 1 food, 0 shields, 0 trade. By default, these coefficients are 3, 2 and 1.
; As an alternative to the name of the terrain, its ordinal index can be used.
;    "0" is the same as "Desert", etc.
; @FERTILITY1 .. @FERTILITY3 can be used for secondary maps, similarly to @TERRAIN1-3.
; In the absence of a @FERTILITY section for a map, defaults are used. Defaults are game type
;    specific, usually 1, 2 (i.e. plains and grasslands), except for the Fantasy game, where
;    the defaults are 3, 5 for map 2 and 3, 4, 5 for map 3.
; This patch also fixes a minor bug in the default fertility calculation where a tile with
;    resource #2 was using the production values from resource #1. Therefore, just having this
;    patch enabled without any @FERTILITY sections will give slightly different fertility values
;    for such tiles compared to the vanilla game.

; TOTPP
; The @OVERLAYS section enables custom overlays from TERRAIN2.bmp for arbitrary terrain types.
; This section consists of a list of terrain types followed by 3 numbers.
; -  For the terrain type you can either use its ordinal index (0-15), the abbreviation
;    used in @TERRAIN (Drt, Pln, etc.), or the full name
; -  The first number is the number of tiles to read, either 1, 3 or 16. When 16, tiles are read in
;    2 rows of 8, similar to the original overlays. When 1 or 3, tiles are read from a single row.
;    The use for the 3-tile overlay is to prevent the dithering used between different terrain types
;    to render on top of the tile. These tiles correspond to the three tiles in TERRAIN1.bmp.
; -  The second number is the height of the tiles, 32, 48 or 64.
;    This reveals the reason to use overlays in TERRAIN2.bmp for 1 or 3 tiles: you can increase
;    the height of these graphics to 48 or 64, instead of being fixed at 32 as they are in TERRAIN1.bmp.
; -  The third number is the y-coordinate in TERRAIN2.bmp from where to start reading the tiles.
;    The starting x-coordinate is always 1.
; Tiles are expected to be separated from each other by a one-pixel border.
; River tiles are always read from their original position of (1, 67). River mouths and coastal tiles
;    shift down, they are read from right below the bottommost overlay.
; In the absence of an @OVERLAYS section, overlays are defined to correspond to a default TERRAIN2.bmp file.
; @OVERLAYS1 .. @OVERLAYS3 can be used for secondary maps, similarly to @TERRAIN1-3.

; Attacks per turn
;
; The numbers in this section define the number of attacks per turn per unit type.
; The section itself consist of a list of numbers, 10 per line, corresponding in order
;    to the entries in @UNITS.
; The number of attacks is limited by the movement rate, as each attack still costs 1 movement point.
; The popup shown when a unit is out of attacks can be overridden in GAME.TXT
;    using the key @ATTACKSPERTURN.
