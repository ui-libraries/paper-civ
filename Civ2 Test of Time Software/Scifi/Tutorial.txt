@title=Civ Tutorial
Your first task is to find a suitable
site and found your capital city.
The best city sites are near rivers,
graminiae, coastal areas, or areas
near special resources.

@BUILDCITY
@width=320
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial
This spot looks like a good site for a
city. Select 'Build New City' from the
ORDERS menu or use the 'b' key to found
a city here.

@FIRSTPRODUCT
@width=420
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Your First City
Each of your cities can build additional
units, or city improvements to further
the growth of your civilization. Only
one item can be in production per city.
Production orders can be changed at any
time.

@FIRSTCIV
@width=420
@title=Civ Tutorial: Civilization Advances
Cities also act as centers for trade and
the flow of information. Your scientists
can collect this information to acquire
important new abilities and skills for
your civilization.

@FIRSTUNIT1
@width=420
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: First Military Unit
You have just built your first military
unit. Use the keyboard arrows to move
this unit and the ORDERS menu to give
special commands. Military units allow
you to explore, expand, attack, and
defend your civilization.

@FIRSTUNIT2
@width=500
@title=Civ Tutorial: Units
Fortify units in your cities to defend
them against barbarians or enemy armies.
^
Colonist and Nidus units can found new
cities as well as build roads, cultivation,
and refineries around existing cities.  If
you can, try to have at least one of these
in play at all times.
^
Fast-moving units are useful for exploring
uncharted territory.

@ONECITY
@width=420
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: New Cities
The city of %STRING0 is growing rather large.
Now might be a good time to expand by building a second
city. To do this, click on %STRING0 and instruct it
to build a Colonist or Nidus. This unit can move to a
new site and build a city.

@CITYSTUFF
@width=420

@title=Civ Tutorial: City Resources
A city's inhabitants produce different raw materials
depending on the types of terrain nearby. On the city
display, "worked" spaces are shown with icons that
represent the output the inhabitants are producing.
^
Experiment with clicking on these spaces to move inhabitants
from space to space; notice that some spaces produce more of
some things, less of others. Most spaces can be improved
through the addition of roads, cultivation, and/or refineries
by Colonists and Niduses. Find the configuration which suits
you best.
^
Notice that you can also remove citizens from the
map altogether, making them Entertainers.  Entertainers
produce Entertainment, but make no food or other resources.

@MINING
@width=320
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Refining
This area could produce more resources.
Building a refinery ('m' key) will add
to the production capacity of %STRING0.

@IRRIGATE
@width=320
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Cultivation
This would be a suitable area to build
cultivation ('i'_key). More food will help
the city of %STRING0 to grow more rapidly.

@ROAD
@width=440
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Roads
This would be a good place to build a
road ('r' key). Your units will be able to move
faster and more data will be generated
in the city of %STRING0.  As you expand,
work towards connecting your cities with
roads.

@HELP1
@width=500
@title=Civ Tutorial: General Principles #1
Defend your cities with at least one
(preferably two) good defensive units.
^
Strike a balance between improving your
existing cities and striking out to found
new cities.
^
Don't expand beyond your ability to defend
yourself; barbarians and hostile armies
can appear without warning.

@HELP2
@width=500
@title=Civ Tutorial: General Principles #2
Make peace with your stronger neighbors.
Isolate and conquer your weaker neighbors.
^
Use ships to explore the seas and transport
your units to other continents (and worlds).
^
Use Arrabers to establish trade routes and
strengthen your economy. Trade helps your
people accumulate both wealth and knowledge.
^
As your civilization grows, don't forget to
use your diplomatic units to learn what your
opponents are up to.

@DISORDER
@width=480
@title=Civ Tutorial: Civil Disorder
@button=Details
A city falls into Civil Disorder when
the number of unhappy citizens exceeds
the number of happy citizens. Growth
and production cease while a city is
in disorder.
^
Remedies for disorder include:
^* Increasing the amount of data used for Entertainment.
^* Moving military units into the city.
^* Building an improvement that increaes happiness.
^* Turning citizens into entertainers.
^
Click on "Details" for further details, or if you
are having difficulty.

@DISORDER2
@width=600
@title=Civ Tutorial: Civil Disorder Details
1) Entertainment: To increase the amount of data used
for entertainment, select "Tax Rate" under the KINGDOM
menu. 20% is often a good rate, especially if your
government is a Hierarchy or Confederation.  For every
two entertainment your city produces, one new happy
citizen appears.
^
2) Martial Law: If your government is a Despotism, Hierarchy,
or Collective, you may move military units into your cities
to suppress disorder. Up to 3 units in each city can be used
for this purpose. Each unit causes one unhappy citizen to
become content.
^
3) Orreries, Hologaming Arcades, and so on: Some improvements
help to reduce disorder by changing one or more unhappy
citizens to content. Of course, if your city is already in
disorder, you may need to "Buy" the building (or temporarily
use entertainers), since no production takes place during
civil disorder.

@DISORDER3
@width=600
@title=Civ Tutorial: Civil Disorder Details
4) Entertainers: On the city display, click on one of the
worked spaces in the city radius to make that citizen into
an entertainer. Entertainers produce no food, materiel, or
data; instead, each produces two additional entertainment.
^
5) Great Joining: If you have discovered the governement type
"The Great Joining", you can switch to that as your form of
government. Under this, no citizen is ever unhappy (of course,
scientific research is curtailed).

@SCHISM
@width=320
@title=Civ Tutorial: Civil War
The %STRING0 are a large and powerful
civilization. However, rebel factions
threaten to start a civil war. If your
armies can capture their capital city,
the shock could split their empire in two!

@SHIPS
@width=480
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Ships
You have built your first naval unit. Use
ships to explore the seas and transport your
units to other continents--and worlds.
^
If your ship is a Yare, remember that it may be lost
if it does not end each turn near a land space.
^
To embark a unit on a ship in port, issue the sleep ('s')
order for the unit before moving the ship out to sea.
Or, while the ship is at sea, simply move
the unit 'onto' the ship from an adjacent space.
^
To disembark a unit, click on the ship or press
the 'u' key to unload.

@RAILROADS
@width=480
@title=Civ Tutorial: Slideways
You have just acquired knowledge of Frictionless
Surfaces, an important achievement. A Colonist, Nidus,
Settler, Melior, or Environeer will build a slideway if
you press the 'r' key in a space that already has a road.
^
Your units will be able to move long distances over
Slideways.  Slideways also increase materiel production
in spaces which already produce at least two materiel.

@FARMLAND
@width=480
@title=Civ Tutorial: Tohubohu
You have acquired knowledge of Prionic Stabilizers. Prionic
control of biochaotic reactions allows you to instigate the
tohubohu process on your land. A Colonist, Nidus, Melior, or
Environeer will improve Cultivation to Tohubohu if you press
the 'i' key in a space that already has cultivation. This will
increase food production in a nearby city once that city has
a Harvester to reap the hyperproductive crop.

@AIRUNIT
@width=480
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Air Units
You civilization has built its first air unit.
Air units can be used to destroy enemy units and cities; they
can also defend your skies from enemy air units. Air units
can also be used to explore.
^
Most air units carry a limited supply of fuel; they must return
to a friendly city or Service Base before that fuel is exhausted.

@REPUBLIC
@width=480
@title=Civ Tutorial: Confederation
Your civilization has gained knowledge of another form
of government, the CONFEDERATION. Switching governments
can bring great benefits to your civilization; on the other
hand, it can create large headaches--careful planning is
necessary. For more information on all forms of government,
see the CIVILOPEDIA entries under "Governments". If you do
wish to switch governments, you must have a Revolution--see
the Kingdom menu.

@DEMOCRATS
@width=600
@title=Civ Tutorial: Confederation & Proteocracy
You have chosen to govern your civilization as a %STRING0.
This is a major change from earlier forms of government, and
will present you with a new set of challenges (and rewards!)
^
As your citizens gain more individual freedoms, they begin
to produce more data. On the other hand, it becomes more
difficult to keep them happy. One of the best ways to do so
is to divert some of your data to entertainment. Select
"Tax Rate" from the Kingdom Menu and set your Entertainment
Rate to 20%%. Since your citizens are now producing so much
more data, you can easily afford this.
^
Your citizens will also tend to become unhappy when you send
your military units out of your cities. You may need to
return some of your units to cities. You may even need to
disband some units. This sacrifice is often worth it in terms
of the knowledge and wealth you will gain in exchange.

@TRADE
@width=420
@title=Civ Tutorial: Trade Guilds
You have just acquired knowledge of TRADE GUILDS. This leads to
Market Economy, which allows your cities to produce ARRABERS to
trade data between different parts of the world. Arrabers can set
up trade routes which, especially from your larger cities, can
rapidly increase your wealth and knowledge.

@CARAVAN
@width=440
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Arrabers
You have just produced your first ARRABER. Move it to a
distant city to establish a data trade route. Trade routes
with small, nearby, and friendly cities produce less revenue
than routes with large, distant and rival cities. Try to find
a city which demands the data your arraber is carrying (you
can click on a rival city to learn its demands).  Arrabers
may also be used to help build Wonders of the World.

@WRITING
@width=420
@title=Civ Tutorial: Monopolium
Your civilization has learned to create MONOPOLIUM. This
ultradense material can be used to make super-tough units.

@SEAFARING
@width=420
@title=Civ Tutorial: Sensing Aqueous
Your civilization has mastered the art of SENSING
AQUEOUS. You may now produce the KELPIE, a submarine
unit that most enemy units find difficult to spot.

@EXPAND0
@width=520
@title=Civ Tutorial: Expansion (#1)
A civilization grows by expanding its territory. This can be
accomplished either by founding new cities or by conquering
rival cities. Perhaps we should instruct one of our cities
to produce a new COLONIST or NIDUS unit.

@EXPAND1
@width=520
@title=Civ Tutorial: Expansion (#2)
For our civilization to grow, we must expand to new
city sites.  Perhaps we should send this new unit to
found a new city.

@DAMAGE
@width=520
@title=Civ Tutorial: Damaged Units
This unit has sustained combat damage, as indicated
by the colored bar near the unit. Green indicates a
relatively healthy unit; Yellow and Red show increasing
levels of damage.
^
A unit may partially heal itself by skipping its entire
turn (press the SPACE bar). Units repair themselves more
quickly in cities and behind force fields. Cities with
a Garrison can repair ground units in a single turn. Other
improvements can repair ships and air units.
