@PEDIAGOVT

@title=Civilization: Governments
The form of government you choose for your civilization will
affect the way resources are distributed in your cities, the
rate at which your citizens can produce and sustain new units
and city improvements, and the extent to which your citizens
have a say in the way you govern them.
^
Some forms of government, such as Despotism, Hierarchy, the
Collective, and The Great Joining, allow rapid expansion,
production and maintenance of large numbers of military
units, and complete control over political affairs.
^
Proteocracy and Confederation, on the other hand, give the
citizens the freedom to produce vast amounts of data, which
increases wealth and knowledge rapidly. These free citizens
often grow unhappy when military units are stationed out of
their home cities. Also, the Senate in these governments can
interfere in the conduct of foreign affairs.
^
To change your civilization's government, you must have a
Revolution--select "Revolution" from the Kingdom Menu.  This
will entail a brief period of Pandemonium.

@PEDIAGOVT0
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Pandemonium
Pandemonium is not so much a type of government as the
lack of any stable government. Pandemonium occurs when
your civilization's government falls or when you decide
to have a Revolution. After a few turns of Pandemonium,
you will be able to reconstitute your government.
^
Pandemonium is similar to Despotism, except that the
inaccuracy rate is very high (see Despotism). No taxes
are collected during a Pandemonium, and no scientific
research is conducted.

@PEDIAGOVT1
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Despotism
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit above the city size costs one materiel per turn.
Settler units require one food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Up to three military units stationed in each city help maintain
order, making one unhappy citizen (per unit) content.
^
^INACCURACY AND WASTE
Despotism has a high rate of inaccuracy and waste.  The level
of inaccuracy in a particular city is based on its distance from
your capital.
^
^SPECIAL
Under a Despotism, none of the tax rates (science, taxes, and
entertainment) may be set higher than 60%.  Also, any terrain
square that would normally produce three or more of a particular
thing (food, materiel, or data) produces one less.
^
^HINTS
Because of Despotism's high rate of inaccuracy, it is almost
always an inferior form of government.  Try to switch to something
else as soon as possible.

@PEDIAGOVT2
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Hierarchy
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit beyond the third costs one materiel per turn.
Settler units require one food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Up to three military units stationed in each city help maintain
order, making one unhappy citizen (per unit) content.
^
^INACCURACY AND WASTE
Hierarchy has a moderate rate of inaccuracy and waste.  The level
of inaccuracy in a particular city is based on its distance from
your capital.
^
^SPECIAL
Under a Hierarchy, none of the tax rates (science, taxes, and
entertainment) may be set higher than 70%.
^
^HINTS
Hierarchy is an excellent form of government for a young
civilization.


@PEDIAGOVT3
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: The Collective
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit beyond the fourth costs one materiel per turn.
Settler units require TWO food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Up to three military units stationed in each city help maintain
order, making TWO unhappy citizens (per unit) content.
^
^INACCURACY AND WASTE
In the Collective, peer review and the free flow of information
virtually eliminates fraud and mistakes in data recording. Your
cities, therefore, experience relatively low rates of inaccuracy.
^
^SPECIAL
All Salmagundy units produced under Collective governments are
given Veteran status.
In the Collective, none of the tax rates (science, taxes, and
entertainment) may be set higher than 80%.
^
^HINTS
The Collective is best for large, far-flung empires which need
to maintain a large military.  Use your powerful spies to
steal technology.

@PEDIAGOVT4
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: The Great Joining
^UNIT SUPPORT
The Unimind can support up to five units without maintenance cost;
additional units cost one materiel each.  Settler units require
TWO food per turn. Only The Great Joining can cultivate the Blue
Willies.
^
^HAPPINESS
All citizens are submerged in the bliss of the Great Joining;
there are no individuals, so no individual is ever unhappy.
^
^INACCURACY AND WASTE
The Great Joining has a low rate of inaccuracy.
However, the endless bliss of merged consciousness has the special
disadvantage that science is halved.
^
^SPECIAL
Improvements which normally convert unhappy citizens to content
citizens instead produce genetic mapping data (Base Pairs) equal to
the number of citizens they would otherwise affect. These improvements
also require no maintenance.
The diplomatic penalties for "terrorist acts" committed by your spying
and diplomatic units are reduced.
In The Great Joining, none of the tax rates (science, taxes, and
entertainment) may be set higher than 80%.
^
^HINTS
The Great Joining eliminates all happiness problems and provides
excellent data revenue. Scientific research tends to languish.


@PEDIAGOVT5
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Confederation
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit costs one materiel per turn.
Settler units require TWO food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Each military unit after the first which is not in a friendly
city or a force field within 3 spaces of a friendly city
causes one citizen in its home city to become unhappy.
^
^INACCURACY AND WASTE
A Confederation has a low rate of inaccuracy and waste. The level
of inaccuracy in a particular city is based on its distance from
your capital.
^
^SPECIAL
Under a Confederation, each terrain square that ordinarily produces
at least one unit of data produces an extra unit.
None of the tax rates (science, taxes, and entertainment) may be set
higher than 80%
^
^HINTS
Switching to a Confederation can give an astounding boost to your
science and tax revenues, although you'll probably have to divert
some of your data to entertainment.  It becomes more difficult and
expensive to keep an army in the field, but building the Organ Bank
wonder can help with this problem.

@PEDIAGOVT6
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Proteocracy
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit costs one materiel per turn.
Settlers require TWO food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Each unit which is not in a friendly city or a force field
within 3 spaces of a friendly city causes TWO citizens in its
home city to become unhappy.
^
^INACCURACY AND WASTE
Proteocracies experience NO inaccuracy or waste.
^
^SPECIAL
Under a Proteocracy, each terrain square that ordinarily produces
at least one unit of data produces an extra unit.
The units and cities of a Proteocracy are immune to bribery.
There are no limits on the tax rate settings (science, taxes, and
entertainment).
^
^HINTS
Proteocracies can produce spectacular amounts of revenue and
scientific research.  However, because of the severe happiness
restrictions on military units, this form of government tends to
be viable only for large, advanced civilizations. Increasing your
luxuries rate and building Wonders can help alleviate this problem.
