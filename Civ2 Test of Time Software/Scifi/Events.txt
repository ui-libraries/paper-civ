Text
Years ago, a magnificent starship filled with valiant settlers set out to reach the star nearest their home world. En route, their sensing devices detected an enormous alien artifact, and they changed course to investigate. Unfortunately for the starship crew and passengers, they somehow activated the artifact's defensive systems.
^
Some sort of gateway opened up directly in front of the colony ship, and the next thing the survivors knew, they were entering the atmosphere of an unknown planet. The ship itself was almost completely destroyed, but due to the heroic efforts of the pilots and security officers, a few small groups managed to survive the fall.
^ 
Their best hope for the future is putting their training to good use--to tame and colonize this new world. If all goes well, then someday, somehow, they might be able to find a way to return home.

One of the ancient "creatures" that seemingly guard the planet
Nona from colonization attempts has been destroyed.
^
Whatever means the strange defender used to transport from place
to place left an unusual residual subatomic vibration signature.
Scientists are confident that research into this phenomenon will
lead to great leaps forward in the physical sciences.
^
Any civilization that attacks and destroys one of these creatures
should become able to research previously unknown topics.

Forces have stopped a destructive, giant being of unknown design,
composition, and origin. Its destruction is not assured, however,
as it might have escaped by as yet unexplainable means.
^
Just before disappearing, the incredible device seemed to generate
and control a confined space-time incongruity in several dimensions.
Experts suggest that this might have been an attempt to escape,
perhaps a successful one. Nearby detectors gathered plenty of data,
and further study of the effect could have untold benefits.
^
Any civilization that attacks and destroys one of these beings should
gain access to new avenus of science.

^^The race to complete the Earthgate has begun!
^
The ability to create Penultimum, combined with Transfer Gate technology,
makes it possible to construct a wormhole with twin openings, connecting
Lalande 21185 (this planetary system) with the Solar system. Ships going
through would be instantly translated into Earth orbit!
^
All scientific efforts are being funneled into Earthgate research.
Whatever civilization completes this project will be the first to reach Earth,
and will be able to control access to the wormhole gate thereafter.

^^The EarthGate has been opened!

A small group of ships has set on a diplomatic mission--to return to the home
world from which our human ancestors sprang and re-open relations with them.

Perhaps someday, with Earth technology added to ours, we will be able to send
emissaries to the home planet of our non-human ancestors, as well.
