@title=Civ Tutorial
Your first task is to find a suitable
site and found your capital city.
The best city sites are near rivers,
glades, coastal areas, or areas
near special resources.

@BUILDCITY
@width=320
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial
This spot looks like a good site for a
city. Select 'Build New City' from the
ORDERS menu or use the 'b' key to found
a city here.

@FIRSTPRODUCT
@width=420
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Your First City
Each of your cities can build additional
Settlers, military units, or city improvements
to further the growth of your civilization.
Only one item can be in production
per city. Production orders can be changed
at any time. Select the item you wish to
build by clicking the 'CHANGE' button in
the city information screen which follows.

@FIRSTCIV
@width=420
@title=Civ Tutorial: Civilization Advances
Cities also act as centers for trade and
the flow of information. Your wise men
and magicians can collect this information
to acquire important new abilities and
skills for your civilization.

@FIRSTUNIT1
@width=420
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: First Fighting Unit
You have just built your first fighting
unit. Use the keyboard arrows to move
this unit and the ORDERS menu to give
special commands. Military units allow
you to explore, expand, attack, and
defend your civilization.

@FIRSTUNIT2
@width=500
@title=Civ Tutorial: Units
Fortify units in your cities to defend
them against barbarians or enemy armies.
Defend your cities with units with good defense
(D) strengths. Your city build window will display
this number for each available unit. It is the
second of the three ADM numbers.
^
Settler units, goblin miners, and dwarves can 
found new cities as well as build roads, irrigation, 
and mines around existing cities.  If you can, try 
to have at least one settler in play at all times.
^
Fast-moving units like Skalds or Jack O'Lanterns are 
useful for exploring uncharted territory.
^
Attack your enemies with Catapults and units with
large attack (A) strengths. Your city build window
will display this number for each available unit.
It is the first of the first of the three ADM numbers.

@title=Civ Tutorial: New Cities
The city of %STRING0 is growing rather large.
Now might be a good time to expand by building a second
city. To do this, click on %STRING0 and instruct it
to build a Settler unit, Dwarf, or Goblin miner. These
units can move to a new site and build a city.

@CITYSTUFF

@title=Civ Tutorial: City Resources
A city's inhabitants produce different resources depending
on the types of terrain nearby. On the city information
screen, "inhabited" spaces are shown with the "wheat",
"shields", and "trade arrows" that the inhabitants are
producing.
^
Experiment with clicking on these spaces to move inhabitants
from space to space; notice that some spaces produce more of
some things, less of others. Most spaces can be improved
through the addition of roads, irrigation, and/or mining by
Settlers, Goblin miners, or Dwarves. Find the configuration 
which suits you best.
^
Notice that you can also remove citizens from the
map altogether, making them "Troubadours".  Troubadours
produce luxuries, but make no food or other resources.

@MINING
@width=320
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Mining
This area could produce more resources.
Mining ('m' key) hills on the surface world
will add to the production capacity of %STRING0. 
This might not be the case on other worlds.

@IRRIGATE
@width=320
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Irrigation
This would be a suitable area to build
irrigation ('i'_key). More food will help the
city of %STRING0 to grow more rapidly. If
you are unsure which terrains profit from
irrigation, check the terrain types in the
civilopedia.

@ROAD
@width=440
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Roads
This would be a good place to build a
road ('r' key). Your units will be able to move
faster and more trade will be generated
in the city of %STRING0.  As you expand,
work towards connecting your cities with
roads. If you are unsure which terrains
profit from roads, check the terrain types
in the civilopedia.

@HELP1
@width=500
@title=Civ Tutorial: General Principles #1
Defend your cities with at least one
(preferably two) good defensive units.
^
Strike a balance between improving your
existing cities and striking out to found
new cities.
^
Don't expand beyond your ability to defend
yourself; barbarians and hostile armies
may appear without warning.
^
Be aware that having too many cities too soon
can increase unhappiness levels.

@HELP2
@width=500
@title=Civ Tutorial: General Principles #2
Make peace with your stronger neighbors.
Isolate and conquer your weaker neighbors.
^
Use Porpoise Pods, Krakens and ships to explore 
the seas and transport your units to other
continents.
^
Use Caravans to establish trade routes and
strengthen your economy. Trade helps your
people accumulate both wealth and knowledge.
Unfortunately, caravans cannot penetrate the
clouds or undersea.
^
As your civilization grows don't forget to
use your Skalds to learn what your
opponents are up to.

@DISORDER
@width=480
@title=Civ Tutorial: Civil Disorder
@button=Details
A city falls into Civil Disorder when
the number of unhappy citizens exceeds
the number of happy citizens. Growth
and production cease while a city is
in disorder.
^
Remedies for disorder include:
^* Increasing the amount of trade used for Luxuries.
^* Moving fighting units into the city.
^* Building a Temple, Monastery, or Arena.
^* Turning citizens into troubadours.
^* Switching to a Fundamentalist government.
^
Click on "Details" for further details, or if you
are having difficulty.

@DISORDER2
@width=600
@title=Civ Tutorial: Civil Disorder Details
1) Luxuries: To increase the amount of trade used for
luxuries, select "Tax Rate" under the KINGDOM menu.
20% is often a good rate, especially if your government
is a Monarchy or Republic.  For every two luxuries your
city produces, one new happy citizen appears.
^
2) Martial Law: If your government is a Despotism, Monarchy,
or Communes, you may move fighting units into your cities
to suppress disorder. Up to 3 units in each city can be used
for this purpose. Each unit causes one unhappy citizen to
become content.
^
3) Temples, Arenas, and Monasteries: These city improvements
help to reduce disorder by changing one or more unhappy
citizens to content. Of course, if your city is already in
disorder, you may need to "Buy" the building (or temporarily
use troubadours), since no production takes place during
civil disorder.

@DISORDER3
@width=600
@title=Civ Tutorial: Civil Disorder Details
4) Troubadours: On the city information screen, click on one
of the inhabited spaces in the city radius to make that
citizen into an troubadour. Troubadours produce no food,
resources, or trade; instead, each produces two additional
luxuries.
^
5) Fanaticism: If you have discovered the civilization
advance "Fanaticism", you can switch to Fanaticism
as a form of government. Under Fanaticism, no citizen
is ever unhappy (of course, magic research is curtailed).

@SCHISM
@width=320
@title=Civ Tutorial: Civil War
The %STRING0 are a large and powerful
race. However, rebel factions threaten 
to start a civil war. If your armies can 
capture their capital city, the shock could 
split the country in two!

@SHIPS
@width=480
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Ships
You have built your first sea unit. Use
them to explore the seas and transport your
units to other continents. Not all sea units
can transport. Check the civilopedia to make sure. 
^
If your ship is a Longboat, remember that it may be lost
if it does not end each turn near a land space.
^
To embark a unit on a sea unit in port, issue the sleep 
('s') order for the unit before moving the sea unit out 
to sea. Or, while the ship is at sea, simply move
the unit 'onto' the ship from an adjacent space.
^
To disembark a unit, click on the sea unit or press
the 'u' key to unload.

@RAILROADS
@width=480
@title=Civ Tutorial: Ley Lines
You have just acquired knowledge of Ley Lines, an
important achievement. A Settler, Dwarf, or Goblin miner
will build a ley line if you press the 'r' key in a space
that already has a road.
^
Your units will be able to move long distances over
ley lines.  Ley lines also increase resource production
in spaces which already produce at least two 'shields'.

@FARMLAND
@width=480
@title=Civ Tutorial: Settled lands
You have acquired knowledge of Dragon's Teeth. The fecund
nature of these teeth when planted allow you to improve 
the quality of your settled lands. A Settler, Dwarf, or
Goblin miner will improve settled lands if you press the 
'i' key in a space that already has irrigation. This will 
increase food production in a nearby city once that city 
has a Farmers Market to distribute the food.

@AIRUNIT
@width=480
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: flying Units
You civilization has built its first flying unit.
Flying units can be used to attack enemy units and cities; 
they can also defend your skies from enemy fliers. Flying
units can also be used to explore.
^
Necromancers, Thunderbolts, and Fireballs have a limited supply 
of magic; they must return to a friendly city or elevated
platform before that magic is exhausted.

@REPUBLIC
@width=480
@title=Civ Tutorial: Althing
Your civilization has gained knowledge of another form
of government, the ALTHING. Switching governments can
bring great benefits to your civilization; on the other
hand, it can create large headaches--careful planning is
necessary. For more information on all forms of government,
see the CIVILOPEDIA entries under "Governments". If you do
wish to switch governments, you must have a Revolution--see
the Kingdom menu.

@DEMOCRATS
@width=600
@title=Civ Tutorial: Althing and Greatlaw
You have chosen to govern your civilization as a %STRING0.
This is a major change from earlier forms of government, and
will present you with a new set of challenges (and rewards!)
^
As your citizens gain more individual freedoms, they begin
to produce more trade. On the other hand, it becomes more
difficult to keep them happy. One of the best ways to do so
is to divert some of your trade to Luxuries. Select "Tax Rate"
from the Kingdom Menu and set your Luxuries Rate to 20%%.
Since your citizens are now producing so much more trade, you
can easily afford this.
^
Your citizens will also tend to become unhappy when you send
your fighting units out of your cities. You may need to
return some of your units to cities. You may even need to
disband some units. This sacrifice is often worth it in terms
of the knowledge and wealth you will gain in exchange.

@TRADE
@width=420
@title=Civ Tutorial: Trade
You have just acquired knowledge of TRADE. Your cities can
now produce CARAVANS to carry trade goods between different
parts of the surface world and underworld. Caravans, especially 
from your larger cities, can rapidly increase your wealth and 
knowledge. Sorry, caravans are incapable of flying or 
snorkling.

@CARAVAN
@width=440
@y=5
@title=Civ Tutorial: Caravans
You have just produced your first CARAVAN. Move it to a
distant city to establish a trade route. Trade routes with
small, nearby and friendly cities produce less revenue than
routes with large, distant and rival cities. Try to find a
city which demands the goods your caravan is carrying (you
may click on a rival city to learn its demands).  Caravans
may also be used to help build Wonders of the World. 
Caravans cannot visit either the undersea or cloud worlds.

@WRITING
@width=420
@title=Civ Tutorial: Ideograms
Your civilization has learned the art of IDEOGRAMS. Your
cities may now commission SKALDS to help make contact
with other civilizations. SKALDS can establish embassies
with other powers, help you keep an eye on your friends, and
even steal knowledge from your rivals.

@SEAFARING
@width=420
@title=Civ Tutorial: Shipbuilding
Your civilization has mastered the art of SHIPBUILDING.
You may now produce JACK O'LANTERNS to help you discover
new territories. Jack O'lanterns can move six spaces per
turn regardless of the terrain, which helps them cover
a great deal of terrain quickly. If you have not yet
done so, consider building sea units to carry your
jack O'lanterns and other units to distant continents.


@EXPAND0
@width=520
@title=Civ Tutorial: Expansion (#1)
A civilization grows by expanding its territory. This can be
accomplished either by founding new cities or by conquering
rival cities. Perhaps we should instruct one of our cities
to produce a new SETTLERS unit, GOBLIN MINER, or DWARF.

@EXPAND1
@width=520
@title=Civ Tutorial: Expansion (#2)
For our civilization to grow, we must expand to new
city sites.  Perhaps we should send these SETTLERS,GOBLIN
MINERS, OR DWARVES to found a new city.

@DAMAGE
@width=520
@title=Civ Tutorial: Damaged Units
This unit has sustained combat damage, as indicated
by the colored bar along the top of the unit.
Green indicates a relatively healthy
unit; Yellow and Red show increasing levels of damage.
^
A unit may partially heal itself by skipping its entire
turn (press the SPACE bar). Units repair themselves more
quickly in cities and fortresses. Cities with Barracks can
repair ground units in a single turn. Other improvements
(Port Facility, Airport) can repair ships and air units.
