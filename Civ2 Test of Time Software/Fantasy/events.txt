Since a babe, you have heard rumors of a great treasure hoard 
guarded by an ancient dragon in a lost cavern deep underground. 
You have also been told innumerable times that a dangerous curse 
would befall anyone who presumes to steal even a single coin of it.
You've never seriously believed the legend until now. Recently 
somebody translated a runic parchment that describes in detail the 
discovery of this chamber. Unfortunately it was found in the hand of 
a dead man who had wandered lost for many months before his demise, 
thereby preventing anyone from retracing his steps. Despite the threat 
of the curse, everyone has gone treasure mad - perhaps yourself as well!
