@title=Civilization: Governments
The form of government you choose for your civilization will
affect the way resources are distributed in your cities, the
rate at which your citizens can produce and sustain new units
and city improvements, and the extent to which your citizens
have a say in the way you govern them.
^
Some forms of government, such as Despotism, Monarchy, and
later Communes and Fanaticism, allow you to expand
rapidly, to produce and sustain large numbers of military
units, and to control your affairs completely.
^
Greatlaw and Althing, on the other hand, give your
citizens the freedom to produce vast amounts of trade, which
increases your wealth and knowledge rapidly. On the other
hand, your citizens may grow unhappy when you send military
units out of your cities; also, your Council may try to
interfere in your conduct of foreign affairs.
^
To change your civilization's government, you must have a
Revolution--select "Revolution" from the Kingdom Menu.  This
will entail a brief period of Anarchy.

@PEDIAGOVT0
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Anarchy
Anarchy represents not so much a government type as the
lack of any stable government. Anarchy occurs when your
civilization's government falls, or when you decide to
have a Revolution. After a few turns of Anarchy, you will
be able to reconstitute your government.
^
Anarchy is similar to Despotism, except that the corruption
rate is VERY HIGH (see entry for Despotism).  However, no
taxes are collected during a period of Anarchy, and no
scientific research is conducted.

@PEDIAGOVT1
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Despotism
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit above the city size costs one shield per turn.
Settlers eat one food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Up to three military units in each city will institute
"martial law", converting an unhappy citizen into a content
citizen.
^
^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
Despotism has a HIGH rate of corruption and waste.  The
level of corruption in a particular city is based on its
distance from your capital.
^
^SPECIAL
Under a Despotism, none of the magic/tax/luxury rates may
be set higher than 60%.  ALSO, ANY SQUARE WHICH WOULD ORDINARILY
PRODUCE THREE OR MORE OF A RESOURCE (FOOD, SHIELDS, TRADE) PRODUCES
ONE LESS.
^
^HINTS
Because of Despotism's high rate of corruption, it is almost
always an inferior form of government.  Try to switch to a
Monarchy as soon as possible.


@PEDIAGOVT2
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Monarchy
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit beyond the third costs one shield per turn.
Settlers eat one food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Up to three military units in each city will institute
"martial law", converting an unhappy citizen into a content
citizen.
^
^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
Monarchy has a MODERATE rate of corruption and waste.  The
level of corruption in a particular city is based on its
distance from your capital.
^
^SPECIAL
Under a Monarchy, none of the magic/tax/luxury rates may
be set higher than 70%.
^
^HINTS
Monarchy is an excellent form of government for a young
civilization.


@PEDIAGOVT3
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Communes
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit beyond the third costs one shield per turn.
Settlers eat one food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Up to three military units in each city will institute
"martial law", converting *TWO* unhappy citizens into
content citizens (so a total of SIX unhappy citizens can
be suppressed).
^
^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
Under Communes, state control of the economy eliminates
crime.  Your cities, therefore, experience no corruption.
^
^SPECIAL
All Faires produced under Communes are given VETERAN status.  
Under Communes, none of the magic/tax/luxury rates may be 
set higher than 80%.
^
^HINTS
Communes is best for large, far-flung empires which need
to maintain a large military.  Use your powerful fairies to
steal technology from the other races.

@PEDIAGOVT4
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Fanaticism
^UNIT SUPPORT
Can support up to EIGHT units for free; additional
units cost one shield each.  Settlers eat two
food per turn.  ONLY the goblin and infidel races can
become fanatical and ONLY Goblins may produce the fanatical
Trolls.
^
^HAPPINESS
Under Fanaticism, NO CITIZEN IS EVER UNHAPPY!
^
^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
Fanaticism has a LOW rate of corruption.
However, Fanaticism has the special disadvantage that
all MAGIC is HALVED.
^
^SPECIAL
Improvements which convert unhappy citizens to
content citizens (Temples, etc.)
produce "tithes" equal to the number of citizens they would
otherwise convert.  They also require no maintenance.
The diplomatic penalties for "terrorist acts" committed by
your skalds and fairies are reduced.
Under Fanaticism, none of the magic/tax/luxury rates may
be set higher than 80%.
^
^HINTS
Fanaticism eliminates all happiness problems and provides
an excellent revenue.  Magic research tends to languish.


@PEDIAGOVT5
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Althing
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit costs one shield per turn.  Settlers eat TWO
food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Each military unit AFTER THE FIRST which is not in a friendly
city (or a fortress within 3 spaces of a friendly city)
causes one citizen in its home city to become unhappy.
^
^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
Althing has a LOW rate of corruption and waste.  The
level of corruption in a particular city is based on its
distance from your capital.
^
^SPECIAL
Under Althing, each square which ordinarily produces at
least one unit of trade produces an extra unit.
None of the magic/tax/luxury rates may be set higher
than 80%.
^
^HINTS
Switching to Althing can give an astounding boost to your
magic and tax revenues, although you'll probably have to
divert some of your trade to luxuries.  It becomes more
difficult (and expensive) to keep an army in the field, but
carving the Glyph of Understanding can help with this
problem.

@PEDIAGOVT6
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Greatlaw
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit costs one shield per turn.  Settlers eat TWO
food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Each unit which is not in a friendly
city (or a fortress within 3 spaces of a friendly city)
causes TWO citizens in its home city to become unhappy.
^
^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
Greatlaws experience NO corruption or waste.
^
^SPECIAL
Under Greatlaw, each square which ordinarily produces at
least one unit of trade produces an extra unit.
The units and cities under Greatlaw are immune to BRIBERY
of all forms.
The magic/tax/luxury rates may be set to any level
desired.
^
^HINTS
Greatlaws can produce spectacular amounts of revenue and
scientific research.  However, because of the severe
happiness restrictions on military units, this form of
government tends to be viable only for large, advanced
civilizations.  Increasing your luxuries rate and building
Wonders can help alleviate this problem.
